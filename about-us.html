    			<h2>Our Vision</h2><br>
    			<p id="visionText">
    			<span id="line1">Meet the needs of the growing Indian economy for skilled personnel.<br><br></span>
India's economy is growing at a fast pace. This growth is improving the income level of the people and ushering in prosperity. However, the growth is hampered due to shortage of skilled manpower in all growing industries. The efficiency and quality of work is suffering for want of skilled personnel in various trades. <br><br>These skills can be imparted by vocational training to boys and girls with school education. The training needs to be job oriented with high element of on-the-job experience and soft skills. KViK’s vision is to impart such training and bridge the gap between demand and supply for skilled Human Resource in the emerging industries.

<h2>Social Objective</h2><br>
    			<p id="visionText">
    			<span id="line1">Upliftment of people from economically and socially weaker sections of the society by making them ‘employable’.<br><br></span>
KViK has been incorporated as a Private Limited Company under section 25 of the Companies Act. Therefore, it is a “not-for-profit” organisation with the sole aim of upliftment of people from economically and socially weaker sections of the society by making them ‘employable’. The courses selected by KViK can be learnt by a student with the basic school education. <br><br>However, desire to learn, work hard and aptitude to follow discipline and self-development are necessary for a trainee to get placement and do well in a job. KViK’s curriculum provides for developing soft skills, including ‘spoken English’, which is so essential in today’s cosmopolitan nature of life in cities. <br><br>
<h2>Mission</h2><br>
		<p id="visionText">

<br><br>
<h2>Training Methodology</h2><br><br>
		<p id="visionText">
    		<span id="line1">High quality training at reasonable cost is the corner stone on which KViK has built its credibility and reputation.<br><br></span>
The KViK logo indicates the focus on 'hand skills' and what a highly skilled person can produce. A highly skilled person also is like a diamond and valued. The curriculum of KViK is based on German “Dual training” model which emphasizes class room teaching and on-the-job training in equal measure. Emphasis is on technical skills as well as soft skills like work culture, adherence to standards, safety and discipline. The courses offered by KViK are affordable to students from economically weaker sections. The cost of the high quality training is met mainly by fees, placement fee and donations. The revenue model is designed to sustain and expand the training facilities in a steady manner.
<br><br>
The DGET has recognised KViK as a Vocational Training Provider (VTP) after a rigorous process of scrutiny and validation of its infrastructure, faculty and other resources. Under the Skill Development Incentive scheme, test of students and issuing of certificates after completion of curriculum and training is done by assessing bodies appointed by DGETs. Tailoring course is based on agreement with USHA International with special curriculum, duration and fee structure.
